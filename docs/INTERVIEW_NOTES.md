## 💬 Interview Talking Points

### Project Overview
- **Problem Statement**: Built a real-time collaborative whiteboard where multiple users can draw, write, and edit simultaneously, with persistence, scalability (up to 100,000+ users), and features like live cursors, undo/redo, and async exports.
- **High-Level Architecture**: Frontend (React + Canvas/Socket.IO) for rendering and optimistic updates; Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO/WebSockets) for event handling; MongoDB for oplog/snapshots; Redis for pub/sub; BullMQ workers for exports; Deployed with Docker + Kubernetes and CDN for assets.
- **Key Technologies**: React (TypeScript), Node.js/Express, Socket.IO, MongoDB (oplog + snapshots every 1,000 ops), Redis (pub/sub), BullMQ, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Sentry.
- **Why It Matters**: Demonstrates FAANG-level engineering with concrete metrics (<200ms latency, 1,000 ops/sec), robust failure handling, rigorous testing, and production-grade security/scalability.

### Technical Highlights
1. **Oplog + Snapshots**:
   - **What**: Implemented an append-only oplog in MongoDB, with snapshots every 1,000 ops or 5 minutes, storing operations (e.g., strokes, text edits) instead of bitmaps for replayable, versioned persistence.
   - **Metrics**: Supports 1,000 ops/sec per server; snapshots reduce replay time to <1s for new clients.
   - **Why**: Ensures auditability, efficient storage, and fast state recovery.
   - **Interview Angle**: Discuss storage optimization, replayability, and snapshot cadence tradeoffs.
2. **CRDT for Conflict Resolution**:
   - **What**: Used operational CRDTs for strokes/shapes and RGA for sticky note text, with unique `opId` (`<userId>:<localCounter>`) and `serverSeq` for deterministic convergence.
   - **Why**: Simplifies conflict resolution vs. Operational Transformation (OT), avoiding data loss seen in Last-Writer-Wins.
   - **Interview Angle**: Explain CRDT vs. OT tradeoffs, immutability benefits, and property-based testing to prove correctness.
3. **WebSocket Scaling**:
   - **What**: Designed stateless Socket.IO servers with Redis pub/sub for cross-instance communication, achieving <200ms op-to-propagation for 100 users and scaling to 100,000+ with sharded Redis and Kafka event logs.
   - **Why**: Enables horizontal scaling and efficient board-specific routing via consistent hashing; WebSockets chosen over polling for low latency.
   - **Interview Angle**: Discuss Redis adapter, sticky sessions vs. stateless design, and multi-region sync with data locality.
4. **Async Export Pipeline**:
   - **What**: Built a BullMQ-based pipeline for server-side rendering (Puppeteer/node-canvas) and S3 uploads, with idempotent retries and signed URLs.
   - **Metrics**: Processes 10 exports/min per worker with <5s average completion time.
   - **Why**: Offloads heavy tasks, ensuring scalability and reliability.
   - **Interview Angle**: Highlight async job patterns, idempotency, and secure file delivery.
5. **Observability**:
   - **What**: Integrated OpenTelemetry for tracing, Prometheus for metrics (p99 latency <200ms, 1,000 ops/sec), Grafana dashboards, and Sentry for error tracking.
   - **Why**: Enables proactive monitoring and bottleneck identification.
   - **Interview Angle**: Discuss p99 latency, tracing for debugging, and alerting setups.
6. **Security & Reliability**:
   - **What**: Implemented JWT with 15-minute rotation and refresh tokens, board-level ACLs (owner/editors/viewers), Socket.IO rate-limiting (100 ops/min/user), and input sanitization.
   - **Reliability**: Graceful degradation (Redis downtime fallback to sticky sessions), idempotent worker retries, and oplog replay for crash recovery.
   - **Security**: Protection against replay attacks via `opId` uniqueness and timestamp validation; sanitization prevents XSS.
   - **Interview Angle**: Discuss JWT rotation strategy, rate-limiting, and handling network partitions.
7. **Failure Scenarios**:
   - **Redis Downtime**: Fallback to sticky sessions via load balancer; ops queued locally and synced on reconnect.
   - **Snapshot/Worker Crash**: Idempotent retries with job deduplication (BullMQ unique job IDs); snapshots ensure partial state recovery.
   - **Network Partitions**: Clients buffer ops locally, replaying on reconnect; server ensures eventual consistency via CRDTs.
   - **Interview Angle**: Explain graceful degradation, recovery mechanisms, and consistency guarantees.
8. **Testing & Validation**:
   - **What**: Used Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E multi-client sync tests, k6 for load testing (1,000 ops/sec), and property-based testing for CRDT correctness.
   - **Why**: Ensures robust conflict resolution and system reliability under load.
   - **Interview Angle**: Highlight property-based testing to prove CRDT invariants and E2E tests for real-world scenarios.
9. **Tradeoffs & Alternatives**:
   - **What**: Evaluated MongoDB (flexible JSON) vs. Postgres (strict schema); Redis pub/sub (simple) vs. Kafka (durable); CRDT (automatic merge) vs. OT (coordination-heavy).
   - **Why**: Chose MongoDB for flexible board data, Redis for fast scaling, and CRDT for simplicity.
   - **Interview Angle**: Discuss performance, complexity, and maintainability tradeoffs.
10. **Scaling Scenarios**:
    - **What**: From 100 users (single server, in-memory state) to 1,000 users (Redis pub/sub, throttled DB writes) to 100,000+ (sharded Redis, Kafka event log, CDN for assets).
    - **Why**: Ensures growth without bottlenecks.
    - **Interview Angle**: Explain sharding, event logs, and CDN for static assets/presence signals.
11. **System Design Expansion**:
    - **What**: Planned multi-region deployment with data locality (regional MongoDB/Redis clusters) and cross-region sync via Kafka; used CDN for static assets and presence signals.
    - **Why**: Reduces latency for global users and improves asset delivery.
    - **Interview Angle**: Discuss multi-region challenges, like cross-region consistency and latency tradeoffs.
12. **Future Enhancements**:
    - **What**: Offline mode with local event queue for later sync; export as images/PDF; session recording/playback; AI tools (shape/handwriting recognition).
    - **Why**: Extends usability and adds value without core redesign.
    - **Interview Angle**: Show forward-thinking design and potential for iteration.

### FAANG/MANG-Relevant Questions to Prepare For
1. **Scalability**: “How would you handle thousands of concurrent users on a single board?”
   - **Answer**: Use Redis pub/sub for Socket.IO scaling, partition boards with consistent hashing, autoscale pods via Kubernetes, and leverage sharded Redis/Kafka for 100,000+ users.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: “How do you ensure deterministic state across clients?”
   - **Answer**: CRDTs with unique `opId` and `serverSeq` ensure commutative operations; snapshots every 1,000 ops reduce replay overhead.
3. **Storage Efficiency**: “How do you manage oplog growth for large boards?”
   - **Answer**: Snapshots every 1,000 ops or 5 minutes and compaction workers archive older ops, balancing storage and performance.
4. **Tradeoffs**: “Why CRDT over OT or Last-Writer-Wins?”
   - **Answer**: CRDT simplifies implementation and avoids data loss; OT is complex, and LWW risks overwriting valid edits.
5. **Security**: “How do you protect against DoS or malicious inputs?”
   - **Answer**: Rate-limit Socket.IO messages (100 ops/min/user) via Redis, sanitize inputs, use JWT rotation, and validate `opId`/timestamps to prevent replay attacks.
6. **Failure Handling**: “What if Redis or a worker crashes?”
   - **Answer**: Redis downtime falls back to sticky sessions; worker crashes use idempotent retries with job deduplication; network partitions handled by local op buffering and CRDT eventual consistency.
7. **Sample Q&A**:
   - **Q**: How would you handle two users drawing on the same part of the board at once?
   - **A**: CRDT-based resolution ensures both updates merge without data loss, using `opId` and `serverSeq` for ordering.
   - **Q**: How do you scale WebSockets beyond a single server?
   - **A**: Redis pub/sub broadcasts events across servers, with sticky sessions or session tokens for routing; multi-region sync uses Kafka.
   - **Q**: How to persist drawings efficiently?
   - **A**: Store as a sequence of operations (events) instead of bitmaps for smaller, replayable, versioned persistence.
