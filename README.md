# Collab Whiteboard üé® ‚Äî Production-Ready & FAANG/MANG-Grade

A **real-time, multi-user collaborative whiteboard** engineered for low-latency drawing, deterministic conflict resolution, and horizontal scaling. Built with a **MERN stack + Socket.IO**, it features an append-only oplog, periodic snapshots, and an async export pipeline. This project showcases production-grade system design, observability, and scalability for technical interviews or enterprise deployment.

## üìä Data Models
### `boards` Collection
```json
{
  "_id": "board_abc",
  "name": "Team Brainstorm",
  "ownerId": "user_123",
  "privacy": "team",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-12T10:00:00Z",
  "lastSnapshotId": "snap_001",
  "snapshotMeta": { "snapshotId": "snap_001", "opIndex": 4567 }
}
```

### `snapshots` Collection
```json
{
  "_id": "snap_001",
  "boardId": "board_abc",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-12T10:00:00Z",
  "snapshotJson": { /* serialized board state: strokes, shapes, notes */ }
}
```

### `oplog` Collection (Append-Only)
```json
{
  "boardId": "board_abc",
  "seq": 4568,
  "opId": "user_123:162", // clientId:localCounter
  "type": "stroke.add",
  "payload": { "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]], "color": "#000", "width": 2 },
  "createdAt": "2025-09-12T10:00:01Z"
}
```

## üì° Real-Time Protocol
### Sample Events
- **Client ‚Üí Server**:
  - `join`: `{ type: "join", boardId: "abc", userId: "user_123" }`
  - `stroke.add`: `{ type: "stroke.add", boardId: "abc", opId: "user_123:162", payload: { ... } }`
  - `cursor.update`: `{ type: "cursor.update", boardId: "abc", userId: "user_123", x: 100, y: 200 }`
- **Server ‚Üí Client**:
  - `op.broadcast`: `{ type: "op.broadcast", boardId: "abc", opId: "user_123:162", serverSeq: 4568, payload: { ... } }`
  - `ack`: `{ type: "ack", opId: "user_123:162", serverSeq: 4568 }`
  - `presence.update`: `{ type: "presence.update", boardId: "abc", users: [{ userId: "user_123", x: 100, y: 200 }, ...] }`

**Design Notes**:
- `opId` (`clientId:counter`) ensures operation uniqueness.
- `serverSeq` or Lamport timestamps ensure deterministic ordering.
- See [docs/protocol.md](/docs/protocol.md) for full schemas.

## üîÑ Conflict Resolution
- **Approach**: Operational CRDT for strokes, shapes, and text (Yjs/Automerge or custom RGA for sticky notes).
- **Why CRDT**: Immutable operations (e.g., `stroke.add`, `stroke.delete`) simplify state convergence without data loss.
- **Tradeoffs**:
  - **CRDT**: Higher memory/message overhead but simpler to reason about.
  - **OT**: Compact but complex to implement correctly.
  - **Last-Writer-Wins**: Avoided due to potential data loss.
- **Interview Tip**: Discuss immutability, opId uniqueness, and snapshot compaction for efficient storage.

## üíº Interview Talking Points
**Resume Line**:
> Engineered a real-time collaborative whiteboard (MERN + Socket.IO) with oplog persistence, snapshotting, and async export pipelines, optimized for scalability and observability.

**Key Topics**:
1. **Oplog + Snapshots**: Enables state replay and efficient storage.
2. **Event Ordering**: `opId` + `serverSeq` vs. Lamport clocks.
3. **WebSocket Scaling**: Redis pub/sub and sticky sessions.
4. **Conflict Resolution**: CRDT vs. OT tradeoffs.
5. **Async Pipelines**: Export jobs, retries, and signed URLs.

**FAANG Questions to Nail**:
- How do you scale WebSockets for thousands of users?
- How do you ensure deterministic state across clients?
- How do you optimize oplog storage and compaction?
- Why choose CRDT over OT or Last-Writer-Wins?
- How do you secure and scale async export workers?
